# Design of BenchTools

## Rationale

BenchTools is a set of tool to make parallel benchmarking easy and consistant.
It defines a specification for benchmark definition, result layout as well as
for result file.

## Concepts

```python
def function():
    pass
```

## Interfaces

## Components

BenchTools consist of a runner, a collector and a analyser. The runner runs test
defined in a hierarchy and store raw results in a well-defined directory
structure. The collector can then be used to gather results in the result
directory using information from the case definition, the gathered information
is stored in a sqlite3 database will a well-defined table structure. The
analyser is a simple tool for simple data analysis, which read the database
generated by Collector. More complicated analysis can be carried out using
pandas and other tools.
